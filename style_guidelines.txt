Style Guidelines – Campus Companion


-Color Theme:
We use a calm and professional color palette. The background color (#F1F6F9) gives a clean and light feel, while accent colors (#14274E, #394867, #9BA4B4) convey a sense of trust and modernity.

-Typography:
We chose the Fira Sans font because it’s simple, readable, and modern. Headings are bold for emphasis, and body text is regular for clarity.

-Iconography:
We use flat-design icons to keep the interface clean and contemporary. This helps users navigate intuitively.

-Buttons:
Buttons have a flat design, consistent with our overall aesthetic, to keep the interface looking sleek.


-These guidelines are reflected in the website design to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly experience.
